# ABOUT_ME
Hi, I'm a software developer and this is where I put my extra projects. Note that many of my projects cannot be shared as they are under NDA.
My personal favorite of these projects was a competition sponsered by The Department of Energy (amongst others) called EcoCAR 3. This project was very exciting for me as I got to work on many things that were completely new to me. Over the course of this two year project I taught myself Python while working on a Raspberry Pi and created a UI for the PI using Python as well as creating a multithreaded input system to handling incoming information from a system of 5 sensors placed on the corners and front of the car and the input from the onboard computer itself to create an entirely new display for more useful HEV information than what was currently visible to the passengers.
